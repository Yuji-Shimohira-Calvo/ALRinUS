title: Introducing RCLinUS
---

Welcome to **Race, Citizenship, and Labour in the US** (RCLinUS), a project in historical sociology. RCLinUS curates an original, large-scale and rare historical data set on every labour strike and lockout occurring in the United States between 1881 and 1905, as detailed in four extensive reports published by the *Commissioner of the US Bureau of Labor* (1881-1886, 1887-1894, 1894-1900, 1901-1905). These data are not currently available in the UK or in Europe. There is no existing publically available electronic resource of these data, *however it will be made publically accessible in due course*.

The data allow us to intersectionally explore:

1. race/ethnicity,
2. naturalization/citizenship status,
3. sector of the economy or industry,
4. detailed geographical dispersion of strikes over time,
5. a proxy measure for strike repression through number of (new) workers before/after the strike or lockout.

These data are complemented with data on underlying racial/ethnic composition at the state level, which we derive from the *Integrated Public Use Microdata Series* (IPUMS) and the Millennial Edition of *Historical Statistics of the United States*.

The researchers in this project are:
Dr. Lilliana Riga (University of Edinburgh)  
Yuji Shimohira-Calvo (University of Edinburgh)
